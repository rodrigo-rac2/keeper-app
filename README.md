# Keeper App

Keeper App is a simple note taking app built with React. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. The app also has a simple access control system, in which only the user who created a note can edit or delete it. The user can edit their own profile by clicking on the profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.

For testing purposes, feel free to use the following credentials to view notes assigned to these users:
- Email: jon@doe.com / Password: 123456
- Email: jane@doe.com / Password: 123456
- Email: admin@keeper.app / Password: root
